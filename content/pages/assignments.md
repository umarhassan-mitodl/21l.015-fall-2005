2.  The presentation should include an investigation of and report on a new media format or genre of interest to the group. For example, a discussion of the technology behind or the use of the following applications would be an appropriate subject: history of search engines, history of Internet, Blogs, wiki, sms and the new media-rich models for telephones, RSS, blogs, "identity sites" such as Friendster, and My Space, Napster, game mods (see {{% resource_link "7fa500e8-6489-4c05-96c4-19f2f75664dc" "QQQ" %}} for an interesting example).

The assignment is to write a 5-7 pages on an independent research topic. For format information see "Guidelines for Papers."

All papers must use at least 3 reference sources. The relevance, accuracy, and source of the reference material as it pertains to the paper topic are to be gauged by the student. The purpose of the library orientation class and our discussions in lecture and recitation about valid references should be taken into account when choosing sources, as they will be taken into account in the grading of the paper.

For example, a discussion of the technology behind or the use of the following applications would be an appropriate subject: history of search engines, history of Internet, Blogs, wiki, sms and the new media-rich models for telephones, RSS, blogs, "identity sites" such as Friendster, and My Place, Napster, game mods (see {{% resource_link "7fa500e8-6489-4c05-96c4-19f2f75664dc" "QQQ" %}} for an interesting example).

Paper 3
-------

### Summary

The third paper should be a rewrite of your first or second paper. (You will get your second paper back, with comments). If you want to discuss one of your previous papers with your TA before rewriting, you should arrange to do so no later than Friday afternoon. If you are satisfied with both of your previous papers, you should use this paper to expand upon some aspect or issue that you have already touched upon.

Project 2 (Podcast)
-------------------

### Summary

Personal Podcast: We will give an introduction to podcasts and describe this project in more detail during the lecture, but here are some initial details: your podcast should be a minimum of 10 minutes (and a maximum of 30, unless you've got something really good in mind). The content of this podcast can be anything you want, but be advised that your podcast:

*   **might** be played in lecture for the class to discuss, and
*   **will** be made available for download from the department Web site.

So if you wouldn't want your friends, family or significant other to hear it, you probably shouldn't include it in your podcast. Check the wiki (after the class) for details on free software that you can use to record the podcast.

Final project and Class Presentation 2
--------------------------------------

### Summary

Since this project accounts for 40% of your grade, you might want to read this carefully. Your final project should (ideally) consist of some type of "creative engagement" with the topic from your group oral presentations. What this means is up to your group, but we'd encourage you to draw upon your own creative skills, talents and experience: video games, audio/video projects, flash animations, dramatic performances, machinima are all fair game; the more creative, the better. If there's a specific project you'd like to tackle, but are worried that you don't have the experience or the necessary equipment to execute, let your TA know. We'll try to work with you (within reason) to make it happen. You're also encouraged to talk to us if you have ideas or questions, and to make sure you're on the right track. Your group should also write a 5-page paper explaining the work You've done, what your goals and ideas were, and how you pursued those goals in the specifics of your project. During one of the final four class sessions, your group will present (and explain) your project to the class. Unless you get prior approval from your TA for a longer presentation, **you will be stopped at 10 minutes**, so practice your presentation ahead of time to make sure you don't run out of time. If you're **really** averse to creative projects, you can opt for an extended group research paper; said paper should be 15-20 pages, and present more substantial research and argumentation than your individual papers have. Since this is supposed to be a fun assignment, consider the paper a last resort.
