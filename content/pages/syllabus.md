Course Description
------------------

Introduction to Media Studies is designed for students who have grown up in a rapidly changing global multimedia environment and want to become more literate and critical consumers and producers of media. Through an interdisciplinary comparative and historical lens, the course defines "media" broadly as including oral, print, performance, photographic, broadcast, cinematic, and digital cultural forms and practices. The course looks at the nature of mediated communication, the functions of media, the history of transformations in media and the institutions that help define media's place in society. This year's course will focus on issues of network culture and media convergence, addressing such subjects as Intellectual Property, peer2peer authoring, blogging, and game modification.

The class as taught this year is a theory and practice course. During the semester we explore different theoretical perspectives on the role of media in influencing our social values, political beliefs, identities and behaviors as well as working with different forms of media production. The class will analyze specific media texts (such as film, net-based media, and sci-fi novels) and explore the standard of values in relation to terms such as "true account" or "real time." When stories take new forms, does that change the nature of the stories themselves? We look at the ways in which the politics of nationality, globalism, and identity influence both the production and reception of media. To represent different perspectives on media, several guest speakers also present lectures. In addition to producing critical writing for the course (non-fiction essay and research papers), students will organize in work groups to produce a media project to be presented at the end of the semester.

Recitations
-----------

Recitations meet on Thursdays during the scheduled class period. Students are expected to take notes from their reading. Reading notes (a one-page minimum) must be handed in at the start of the recitation session each week. They may also be posted on the discussion site for the class or as blog entries. Please email your recitation TA if you chose to electronically post notes-in this case, notes must be posted the evening prior to the second lecture each week.

Plagiarism
----------

The use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgement is a serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution consult the style guides available in the {{% resource_link "6a5b879a-1a10-4f6f-928d-ab5f33670aad" "Writing and Communication Center" %}}.
